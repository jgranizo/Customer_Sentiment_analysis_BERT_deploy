                "Content": "Apple\u00a0released updates for its iPhone, iPad and Mac software on Wednesday that include a long-awaited ChatGPT integration with Siri.\n\nThe ChatGPT integration triggers when users ask Siri complicated questions. When Siri is asked a question that Apple\u2019s software identities as better suited for ChatGPT, it asks the user permission to access the OpenAI service. Apple says that it has built in privacy protections into the feature, and that OpenAI won\u2019t store requests. The integration uses OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o model.\n\nApple users don\u2019t need an OpenAI account to make use of the ChatGPT integration, but users can pay for upgraded versions of ChatGPT through Apple. Users can also access ChatGPT through some text menus.\n\nThe iOS 18.2 release is a critical milestone for Apple, which is relying on Apple Intelligence to lead the iPhone 16 lineup\u2019s marketing campaign. Apple Intelligence is the company\u2019s suite of artificial intelligence features. Apple first announced the ChatGPT integration back in June.\n\nApple\u00a0released\u00a0the first part of Apple Intelligence in October. Those features included writing tools that can proofread or rewrite text, a new design for Siri that makes the whole phone screen glow and notification summaries.\n\nThe company says it will release another update to Apple Intelligence next year that includes significant improvements to Siri, including the ability for it to take actions inside of apps.\n\nMany investors believe that as Apple Intelligence adds features, it will boost iPhone sales, drive an upgrade cycle and potentially cement Apple as a leader in consumer-oriented AI.\n\nThe integration is also a major victory for OpenAI as it puts its most important product in front of millions of iPhone users. Neither Apple nor OpenAI have disclosed financial terms for the arrangement.\n\nUsers need an iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro or any iPhone 16 model to install and use Apple Intelligence, even though the ChatGPT integration primarily uses cloud servers. Owners of iPhones can turn on software updates in the General section of the Settings app.\n\nAfter updating to the latest Apple software, users who have not yet activated Apple Intelligence can sign up for a waitlist inside the settings app. Users typically receive access to the software within the same day. Their phones will need to download large files, including Apple\u2019s AI models, that the service needs to operate.\n\nThe Wednesday updates also include Apple\u2019s image generating app, called Playground, which can create images based on people or prompts, and Image Wand, a feature that allows users to remove objects or flaws from photographs.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/apple-launches-its-chatgpt-integration-with-siri.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/apple-launches-its-chatgpt-integration-with-siri.html)"

                "Content": "\u201cJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.\n\n\u201cMy heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,\u201d Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.\n\nBezos\u2019s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.\n\nOne of the cornerstone projects under Bezos\u2019s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s AI capabilities.\n\nAlthough Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon\u2019s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google\u2019s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be there to help, and right now, I\u2019m putting a lot of time into it,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cIt\u2019s super interesting, so why not?\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.\n\nBezos\u2019s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon\u2019s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company\u2019s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.\n\nBezos\u2019s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon\u2019s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos\u2019s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.businesstoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/my-heart-is-in-amazon-jeff-bezos-returns-to-amazons-frontlines-with-a-focus-on-ai-456555-2024-12-07"

                "Content": "\n\nShares of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) saw a 4% increase in pre-open trading Tuesday, reflecting investor confidence following the company's unveiling of its new quantum computing chip, Willow. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, introduced the chip on Monday, highlighting its ability to significantly reduce computational errors and its performance in benchmark tests.\n\nPichai emphasized the chip's potential in practical applications, stating, \"We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design + more.\"\n\nThe new chip, according to Pichai, has achieved two major milestones. It can exponentially decrease errors with the addition of more qubits, addressing a quantum error correction challenge that has persisted for nearly three decades. In addition, Willow completed a standard benchmark computation in less than five minutes, a task that would take one of the fastest supercomputers today more than 10 septillion years.\nThis development is part of Google's long-term commitment to quantum computing, a vision that began over a decade ago when Pichai founded Google Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) AI in 2012. \n\nThe goal is to build a quantum computer that leverages quantum mechanics to advance scientific discovery and address societal challenges.\n\nThe announcement drew a simple yet telling reaction from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, who expressed his astonishment with a single word, \"wow,\" on social media platform X.\n\nThe Willow chip represents a significant advancement for Google Quantum AI and positions the company closer to achieving commercially viable quantum computing applications."

The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook\u00a0[Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.\n\nReddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google\u2019s search engine this year.\n\nFarhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: \u201cGoogle\u2019s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.\u201d\n\nOfcom also speculated that the change may have been caused\u00a0[by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit\u2019s stock market flotation in March this year.\n\nThe popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its\u00a0[takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal)\u00a0but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X\u00a0[launched by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).\n\nThe Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog\u2019s annual report into the nation\u2019s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.\n\nThe misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of electoral fraud in the UK.\n\nThe regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence."

There is a concentrated area downtown which has a number of apartment high rises and some shops. And there are some larger projects (notably Kenilworth in 20019 and Barry Frams in 20020), which although I ventured into a number of times, are....rough.\n\nIts a really complex problem. Its in part of DC called 'East of the (Anacostia) River' or EOTR. And has historically been an impoverished black part of the city. Even in the 90s when all of DC was rough, this area was the worst of the worst. And because of the river its remained sectioned off, and even despite investments from DC, has been the slowest to proper in the thriving DC. The same reason that Amazon doesnt want to deliver there is the same reason its a food desert - crime. The most egregious corporate offender though was Walmart who agreed to put 2? stores in 20019 and 20020 back in \\~2017 if memory serves in exchange for puting stores in more affluent parts of DC. They built the stores they wanted and then reneged on the 2 others, and saw no consequences.\n\nI understand why Amazon doesn't feel like its safe to deliver there, but I had prime when I lived there, and it helped tremendously to offset the food/shopping desert. There needs to be stronger representation (Trayon White down in 20020 for example is a criminal who keeps getting relected), and more advocacy groups need to be vocal about the issues in this part of DC.\n\nI know this is a stock sub - this will be an immaterial lawsuite for amazon - but its a major social and political issue that many urban areas across the country face. These large companies need to be held at least somewhat accountable to provide equal services, they certainly get preferential treatment in our society, they should be helping to solve these issues not contributing to them, they certainly have the capital to do so.\n\nQuick note: I loved living in 20019 - understanding that I have a different perspective I am privileged (good income, white male) - the neighborhood was warm and welcoming, we would help each other out, and there were many genuinely kind people. I would not hesitate to return at a different stage in life.": {

                "Content": "\u201cJeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and former CEO, has re-emerged as a driving force at the tech giant, dedicating 95% of his time to advancing artificial intelligence initiatives. Speaking at the DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bezos expressed his enduring connection to the company he founded 30 years ago, even after stepping down as CEO in 2021.\n\n\u201cMy heart is in Amazon, my curiosity is in Amazon, and my fears are there, and my love is there,\u201d Bezos said, reinforcing his deep ties to the company and its mission.\n\nBezos\u2019s renewed focus on AI comes as Amazon seeks to assert itself in the rapidly evolving technology landscape. The company is currently developing over 1,000 internal AI applications and aims to leverage this momentum to remain competitive with industry giants like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI.\n\nOne of the cornerstone projects under Bezos\u2019s watch involves building a cutting-edge supercomputer in partnership with Anthropic, the AI startup in which Amazon recently invested $8 billion. This supercomputer is expected to power a multimodal AI model capable of analysing images, video, and text, further enhancing Amazon\u2019s AI capabilities.\n\nAlthough Bezos stepped down as CEO to focus on his space venture, Blue Origin, he continues to serve as Amazon\u2019s executive chairman, actively supporting CEO Andy Jassy and the leadership team. His involvement mirrors a broader trend of tech founders, such as Google\u2019s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, returning to their companies to steer AI-focused strategies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be there to help, and right now, I\u2019m putting a lot of time into it,\u201d Bezos said. \u201cIt\u2019s super interesting, so why not?\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s AI ambitions are supported by significant investments in infrastructure and talent. The company is betting big on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence to enhance its services and operations, positioning itself as a serious contender in the ongoing AI race.\n\nBezos\u2019s hands-on approach signals his commitment to Amazon\u2019s future during this pivotal time in technological innovation. His involvement aligns with the company\u2019s broader goals of integrating AI into various aspects of its operations, from customer service to cloud computing.\n\nBezos\u2019s renewed focus on Amazon coincides with a surge in his net worth, which reached $228 billion last month, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The increase was driven by Amazon\u2019s stock hitting a record $207.09 per share, boosting Bezos\u2019s wealth by $7 billion as he continues to hold nearly 9% of the company.\u201d\n\nSource: https://www.businesstoday.in/amp/technology/news/story/my-heart-is-in-amazon-jeff-bezos-returns-to-amazons-frontlines-with-a-focus-on-ai-456555-2024-12-07"

Behind his nearly $20 billion jump in wealth was a deal that shot up Musk\u2019s rocket company SpaceX\u2019s valuation to roughly $350 billion, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares. Tesla shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, hitting $424.77 at market close. Musk, who is Tesla\u2019s largest individual shareholder, has also enjoyed the stock propelling higher in part due to the broader market \u2014 NASDAQ topped 20,000 for the first time ever Wednesday. Since Election Day, the EV maker\u2019s stock has rallied roughly 65% on investors\u2019 belief that Musk\u2019s influence in the Trump administration will usher in an era of deregulation that will benefit the company.\n\n> His artificial intelligence startup, xAI, also more than doubled in value in November amid a new funding round, surging to $50 billion from a few months ago, according to the Wall Street Journal. The world\u2019s wealthiest man is now roughly $136 billion richer since November 5, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While the top spots on the billionaires index typically switch around, Musk is racing past his wealthy peers. As of December 10, before his wealth skyrocketed to $400 billion, he was already $140 billion richer than the second-richest man on Earth, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n> Musk\u2019s record-breaking Tesla-shareholder-approved pay package, which was worth $101 billion, was rejected by a Delaware court last week. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation still seems to include the pay package, which is now worth as much as $120 billion based on the current value of Tesla shares."

It managed to climb to the top of the best-selling electric pickups chart in the second quarter in the United States, surpassing the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning, both of which have been on sale for longer.\n\nBut the initial boost seems to be drying out. Yesterday, workers at Tesla\u2019s Austin factory, which assembles the Cybertruck, were told to stay home for the next three days, according to a memo seen by Business Insider. \"On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday this week (Dec. 3-5), you do not need to report to work,\" the memo said.\n\nWorkers were told to report back to work on Friday and that they would still be paid for the three days that they were supposed to work. Tesla doesn\u2019t reply to questions from the media, so there\u2019s no way of confirming if this is related to a demand problem or something else. Some workers would not follow the adjusted schedule and would be notified separately, the memo said.\n\nHowever, factory workers on the Cybertruck line have occasionally been given other duties instead of building trucks since late October, according to Business Insider. Four workers said they had inconsistent schedules in the past month, either because they were sent home or given additional training exercises or cleaning duties instead of regular duties.\n\n\"When I started at Tesla you could expect to get overtime pay, now I feel lucky to get 40 hours,\" one worker on the Cybertruck line said.": {

                "Content": "Tesla\u00a0shares jumped to an all-time high on Wednesday, surpassing their prior record reached in 2021, sparked by a post-election rally and Wall Street\u2019s increased enthusiasm for\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0electric vehicle company.\n\nThe stock rose to an intraday high of $415, which is 50 cents above its previous peak, and was on pace to close ahead of its highest finish, which was $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021.\n\nTesla\u2019s market value has swelled by about 66% this year, with almost all of those gains coming since\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0election victory early last month. The stock\u2019s 38% rally in November marked its best monthly performance since January of 2023 and its 10th best on record.\n\nMusk poured $277 million into a pro-Trump campaign effort, according to Federal Election Commission filings, and turned his support for the Republican nominee into another full-time job ahead of the election, funding a\u00a0swing-state operation\u00a0to register voters and using his social media platform X to constantly tout his preferred candidate, frequently with misinformation.\n\nThe world\u2019s richest person, who\u2019s seen his net worth swell to over $360 billion, is set to lead the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency,\u201d alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\nHis new role could give Musk power over federal agencies\u2019 budgets, staffing and the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. Musk said during a Tesla earnings call in October that he intended to use his sway with Trump to establish a \u201cfederal approval process for autonomous vehicles.\u201d Currently, approvals happen at the state level.\n\n\u201cThe stock is responding to the Trump bump,\u201d Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM,\u00a0told CNBC\u2019s\u00a0\u201cSquawk on the Street\u201d last week. Irwin had just increased his price target to $380 from $85, writing in a report that \u201cMusk\u2019s authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla\u2019s pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining a parade of firms that have lifted their price expectation or their rating on the stock. The Goldman analysts wrote that \u201cthe market is taking a more forward-looking approach to Tesla, including with respect to its AI opportunity.\u201d\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley and Bank of America have also issued bullish reports of late.\n\nSince Trump\u2019s victory, Musk has been accompanying the president-elect in meetings with world leaders, and began advising him and members of Congress as to which federal agencies, regulations and budget items the billionaire would like to eliminate or greatly reduce.\n\nTesla\u2019s surge to a record marks a dramatic turn from its performance to start the year. The company\u2019s shares\u00a0plunged 29% in the first three months\u00a0of 2024, the worst quarter for the stock since the end of 2022 and the third worst since Tesla went public in 2010. At the time, investors were concerned about Tesla\u2019s core business, which reported\u00a0declining revenue\u00a0in the first quarter in part due to increased competition from China.\n\nIn its\u00a0third-quarter earnings report\u00a0in October, Tesla reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 8%, which fell just shy of estimates. However, the company reported better-than-expected profit, and Musk said on the earnings call that his \u201cbest guess\u201d is that \u201cvehicle growth\u201d will reach 20% to 30% next year, due to \u201clower cost vehicles\u201d and the \u201cadvent of autonomy.\u201d That forecast was ahead of analysts\u2019 predictions.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/tesla-reaches-record-boosted-by-64percent-pop-since-trump-election-victory.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/11/tesla-reaches-record-boosted-by-64percent-pop-since-trump-election-victory.html)"

And if not Tesla will most likely be excluded from California's EV tax credits which is the inspiration for 12 other states that may or may not follow California's example.\n\nFurther Tesla is becoming less of an exclusive brand and revenue (which hasn't seen real growth the last quarters) is mainly from more discounted cars. Of course Tesla is more than just the cars, but it is their core business..\n\nDo you think lower revenue might tank the stock or will it still be interesting due to the different other businesses or that Elon Musk as a CEO is already enough to keep investors in."

The leap took Reddit above LinkedIn and X into fifth place on the table of UK social media platforms, which is now topped by YouTube after it overtook\u00a0[Facebook](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook), reaching more than 44 million adults.\n\nReddit, renowned for its devoted user base who refer to one another as Redditors, appears to have been boosted by updates to Google\u2019s search engine this year.\n\nFarhad Divecha, the managing director of the UK-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast, said: \u201cGoogle\u2019s latest algorithm update in the first half of 2024 gave Reddit a big boost in organic search traffic. I think that has probably contributed a lot.\u201d\n\nOfcom also speculated that the change may have been caused\u00a0[by alterations to how third-party apps accessed its content](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jun/14/reddit-moderators-vow-to-continue-blackout-in-api-access-fees-row), forcing users of those apps to switch to the Reddit site. The watchdog also flagged publicity around Reddit\u2019s stock market flotation in March this year.\n\nThe popularity of X also fell over the same period, according to Ofcom, with its reach falling by 8% since May last year. X has been criticised over content moderation standards since its\u00a0[takeover by Elon Musk in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/oct/28/elon-musk-twitter-hate-speech-concerns-stock-exchange-deal)\u00a0but it has also faced competition since July 2023 from Threads, a rival to X\u00a0[launched by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s Meta](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/06/meta-launches-twitter-rival-threads-in-100-countries).\n\nThe Ofcom figures featured in the watchdog\u2019s annual report into the nation\u2019s digital habits, which revealed that four out of 10 UK adults say they have encountered misinformation or deepfakes, with the majority of those cases occurring online.\n\nThe misinformation survey, based on a poll of more than 4,000 UK adults, also found that three in 10 adults believe there is a single group of people who control the world together, with the same number believing there is \u201csignificant evidence\u201d of electoral fraud in the UK.\n\nThe regulator also found that one-third of UK adults are not confident in judging whether an image or a piece of audio or video has been created by artificial intelligence."
