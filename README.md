# Customer_Sentiment_analysis_BERT
 developed a real-time entity-specific sentiment analysis system using data mining and natural language processing techniques. The goal is to accurately identify entities mentioned in social media posts, particularly tweets, and determine the sentiment expressed towards each entity. By fine-tuning small-scale foundation language models (LLMs) like DistilBERT or TinyBERT on a cleaned and preprocessed Twitter dataset, we aim to achieve high accuracy in aspect-based sentiment classification. This system will enable businesses to gain granular insights into public perception of specific products, services, or brands.
