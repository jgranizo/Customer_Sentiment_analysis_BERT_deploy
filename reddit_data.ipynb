      ">Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, the country’s Industry Minister, declared that any iPhone 16 found in the hands of consumers will be deemed illegal. He cautioned potential buyers against acquiring the device from abroad, emphasising the seriousness of the ban.\n",

      "Why Indonesia Banned Apple iPhone 16 \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "''The ban stems from Apple’s failure to fulfill its investment commitments in Indonesia. Reports indicate that the tech giant has invested approximately 1.48 trillion Rupiah (around $95 million) of the promised 1.71 trillion Rupiah, resulting in a shortfall of about 230 billion Rupiah ($14.75 million). Kartasasmita explained that the Ministry of Industry has been unable to issue permits for the iPhone 16 because Apple has yet to meet its obligations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this month, the minister had already indicated that the iPhone 16 could not be sold in the country due to the pending TKDN certification, which requires that 40 percent of a product’s content be sourced locally. This certification is crucial for Apple as it is linked to the company’s commitment to establish research and development facilities in Indonesia, known as the Apple Academy.''\n",
      "Comment 3: The “leaves tourists in a lurch” part is because the IMEIs of iPhone 16s are illegal to register in Indonesia and devices may be confiscated. \n",

      "(Missing from the headline / OP’s submission)\n",
      "Comment 4: I have a feeling this is going to hurt Indonesia a lot more than Apple. Especially with the 40% local product content part, that part will be a lot more costly for Apple than the $15 Million they owe.\n",

      "Citing multiple people “directly involved” in making components for the headset, the report says that the scaling back of production began in the early summer. This indicates that Apple now has a sufficient number of Vision Pro units in its inventory to meet demand for the device’s remaining lifespan through to next year.\n",
